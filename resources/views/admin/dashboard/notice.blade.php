    Hi Jenny and Jennifer,
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Thanks for your support, without which this web app of our database would not be working here. Sincerely thank you!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Since so far we only have data of student and faculty members, this app, for now, has 3 major functionalities:
    <ol>
        <li>
            1, You can see all <strong>student members'</strong> information, and query records using student filters.
        </li>
        <li>
            2, You can see all <strong>faculty members'</strong> information, and query records using student filters.

        </li>
        <li>
            3, And you can import data of student, faculty and student's majors; more importers would be dependent on the data I will receive.
            <strong>I temporarily disabled this functionality because all data we have now are already loaded into the database.</strong>
            <strong>After we talk about the format of raw data files, I will re-enable this functionality.</strong>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
    More functionalities are on their way, including:
<ol>
    <li>1, A Data Visualization (Charts) Wizard that will enable you to customize your charts,</li>
    <li>2, CEWiT Event Tracker, which is dependent our event data that hopefully I can have soon,</li>
    <li>3, multiple Data Exporters to export filtered or all data into CSV or other formats,</li>
    <li>4, And etc.</li>
</ol>
</p>
